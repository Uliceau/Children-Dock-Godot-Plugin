This plugin will let you see the children nodes of the currently selected node in your tree in a seperate dock to make your life easier, especially when working with component driven projects.

You can navigate in the panel to get the desired node in the selected parent node in the scene tree.

Note that this plugin was made with the extensive use of AI (DeepSeek R1), as it was my first plugin.
